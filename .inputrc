# Inputrc deals with the mapping of the keyboard for certain situations.
# This file is the start-up file used by readline, the input related library
# used by bash and most other shells.

# =================
# Tab Improvements
# =================

# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on
# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off
# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

TAB: menu-complete
# Flip through autocompletion matches with Shift-Tab.
"\e[Z": menu-complete

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off
